# bolt-app
Project to develop a bolt to connect a Slack shortcut with the creation of a Salesforce case. This communication takes place via Web-To-Case and a Salesforce flow triggered when creating the case returns a request to the bolt to send the message to the channel and thread from which the shortcut was triggered.
